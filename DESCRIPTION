Description: A set of tools to connect, query, and operate on information available from 
  the Open Source Vulnerability Database. Although CRAN has vulnerabilities listed, these are few compared 
  to projects such as PyPI. With tighter integrations between R and Python, having an R specific package to 
  access details about vulnerabilities from various sources is a worthwhile enterprise.
