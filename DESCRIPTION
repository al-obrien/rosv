Title: Client to Access and Operate on the 'Open Source Vulnerability' API

Description: Connect, query, and operate on information available from the 
    'Open Source Vulnerability' database. Although CRAN has vulnerabilities 
    listed, these are few compared to projects such as PyPI. With tighter 
    integrations between R and Python, having an R specific package to access 
    details about vulnerabilities from various sources is a worthwhile enterprise.
