Title: Client to Access and Operate on the 'Open Source Vulnerability' API

Description: Connect, query, and operate on information available from the 
    'Open Source Vulnerability' database <https://osv.dev/>. Although 'CRAN' 
    has vulnerabilities listed, these are few compared to projects such as 
    'PyPI'. With tighter integration between 'R' and 'Python', having an 
    'R' specific package to access details about vulnerabilities from 
    various sources is a worthwhile enterprise.
