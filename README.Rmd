# rosv

Use R to query the Open Source Vulnerability (OSV) database. This can be useful to 
cross check the database with packages used in `requirements.txt` (python) or `renv.lock` files (R).
The generated content can also be used to create block lists for curated repositories with Posit Package Manager.

## Installation

You can install {rosv} only from GitHub:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github('al-obrien/rosv')
```


## Example

The most basic usage of {rosv} is to pull all versions of PyPI or CRAN packages listed 
on the OSV database.

```{r example, eval = FALSE}
library(rosv)
pypi_vul <- create_osv_list()
pypi_vul
```
