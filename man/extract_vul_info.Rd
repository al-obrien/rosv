\title{Extract key OSV information from JSON}
\usage{
extract_vul_info(file, delim = "\\t", version_placeholder = " ")
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{File path to the folder containing the OSV JSON files.}

\item{delim}{The deliminator to separate the package and version details.}

\item{version_placeholder}{Value to fill if no versions are listed for package.}
}
\description{
Use the downloaded JSON dataset from OSV and extract key details on package and versions listed.
Packages that do not have a listed version will have a blank space as the default placeholder.
This makes it easier for \code{strsplit} to operate on the string in other steps,
which will not perform as expected without some value coming after the delimiter.
